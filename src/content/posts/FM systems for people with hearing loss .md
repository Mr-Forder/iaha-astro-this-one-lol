FM and DM systems help people hear better in noisy or group settings by sending a speaker’s voice directly to a listener’s receiver. Often used in schools, they also benefit adults in meetings, restaurants, and public venues. These systems reduce background noise and listening fatigue, and work alongside hearing aids or on their own. Here's a detailed guide from Healthy Hearing to give you the lowdown on FM/Radio Systems.
