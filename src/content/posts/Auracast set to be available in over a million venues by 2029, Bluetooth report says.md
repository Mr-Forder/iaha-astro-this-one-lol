Bluetooth’s next-generation feature, Auracast, is poised to revolutionise accessibility, with over 1.5 million venues expected to offer inclusive listening experiences by 2029. Unlike traditional Bluetooth, Auracast allows unlimited devices—like hearing aids and earbuds—to tune into the same audio broadcast, removing barriers in public spaces.

Already live in venues like the Sydney Opera House and recently trialled at St Paul’s Cathedral, Auracast is gaining traction in the UK, with theatres like the National, the Bridge and the Barbican exploring adoption. <a class="teal-text" href="https://liamodell.com">Liam O'Dell</a> investigates.
