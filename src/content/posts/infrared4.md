### Accessibility in Museums: Infrared Listening Made Easy

Museums, galleries, and exhibition spaces are increasingly looking for unobtrusive ways to enhance access—and **infrared assistive listening systems** offer a smart solution.

These systems transmit audio via light waves, allowing visitors with hearing loss to receive **direct, high-quality sound** through personal receivers—ideal for lectures, guided tours, or video exhibits.

Because the signal remains contained within the space, it won’t interfere with nearby rooms or installations. And since IR systems don’t emit radio waves, they avoid potential tech conflicts.

At IAHA, we believe in making **culture and learning inclusive for everyone**—and infrared listening helps museums meet that goal with elegance and efficiency.
