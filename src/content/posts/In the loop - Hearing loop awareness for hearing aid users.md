title: In the loop - Hearing loop awareness for hearing aid users
description: "“There are still many shops, offices and other public locations that do not have a hearing loop, or it is not working properly, or there’s no information to let you know it’s there, or staff don’t understand how to use it. In these cases, even though a loop system may have been installed, the service provider is failing to comply with the law that requires them to ensure equality of service to all customers.”"
