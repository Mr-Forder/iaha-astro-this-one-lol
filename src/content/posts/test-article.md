description: '"The hearing device brands and models listed below come equipped with a telecoil, and some have added Auracast capability. Instruments that have a telecoil in an accessory are not included because they are one more thing to remember, charge, and troubleshoot â€“ as well as adding complexity and barriers for individuals with limited dexterity, limited cognitive abilities, or limited tech familiarity."'

The Center For Hearing Access provides a comprehensive list of hearing device brands and models that are considered ADA compatible, noting the importance of making sure that devices must utilise Auracast in addition to a telecoil in the device itself, and not as an accessory.

Note: this is a US survey, and the products listed may only be available to US markets.
