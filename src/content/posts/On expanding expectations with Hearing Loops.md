Juliette Sterkens joins AccessiBe’s Spotlight Sessions to talk about advocating for hearing loops and the work of the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA), highlighting the US’s need to catch up on legislation to bring hearing loops into the remit of legal requirements for all in public places of accommodation, as well as the need for consumer voices in raising awareness about essential assistive technologies.
