### Shining a Light on Infrared Assistive Listening Technologies

As public venues continue to embrace inclusive design, **infrared (IR) assistive listening systems** are playing a growing role in making shared spaces more accessible for people with hearing loss. Unlike radio frequency or hearing loop systems, infrared ALTs use light-based transmission to deliver high-quality audio directly to listeners — offering a discreet, secure, and effective solution in settings where privacy and signal containment are essential.

Infrared systems are particularly well-suited to environments like **courtrooms, conference centers, cinemas, and corporate boardrooms**, where audio must remain within the room and cannot risk interference from nearby systems. Because IR signals require line-of-sight, these systems also offer **controlled coverage** — making them ideal for sensitive or segmented environments.

At IAHA, we’re working to raise awareness of the full range of assistive listening technologies available today, including infrared systems. As technology and user needs evolve, it’s more important than ever to match the right solution to the right space — and to ensure that no one is left out of the conversation.
