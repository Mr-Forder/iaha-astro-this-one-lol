### Secure Sound: Infrared Listening in Courtrooms

In spaces where privacy and clarity are paramount—like courtrooms—**infrared (IR) assistive listening systems** offer a secure and effective option.

IR systems transmit audio via invisible light waves to receivers worn by the listener. This line-of-sight technology ensures the signal doesn’t travel beyond the room, making it ideal for confidential proceedings.

Used in legal, medical, and diplomatic settings, IR systems are resistant to interference and preserve **auditory integrity** in sensitive situations.

At IAHA, we support **solutions tailored to context**—and in high-security spaces, infrared remains a gold standard for discreet accessibility.
