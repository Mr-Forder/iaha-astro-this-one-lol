In busy environments like **museums, train stations, or galleries**, background noise and acoustics can make it difficult for visitors to hear announcements, guides, or presentations.

Auracast provides a smart, scalable solution. By transmitting audio wirelessly to any compatible device, venues can **bypass the need for physical handsets**, reducing both logistical burden and sanitation concerns.

For users with hearing loss, this means accessing venue audio through familiar technology—be it hearing aids or smartphones—**without needing to request special equipment**. For everyone else, it opens up the potential for **personalised, high-fidelity sound in shared settings**.

Auracast transforms public audio from a one-size-fits-all challenge into a **user-first experience**, and we believe it can help reimagine what true accessibility looks like in public life.
