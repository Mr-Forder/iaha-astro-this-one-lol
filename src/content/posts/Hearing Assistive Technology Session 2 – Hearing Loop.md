Andrew Stewart, HMA Life Member and 2015 Libby Harricks Award recipient, has worn hearing aids since the age of seven. Now using two cochlear implants, he advocates for systemic change to improve access for people with hearing loss.

In this video session from Hearing Matters Australia, he offers unique insights into hearing technologies like loops, FM, and infrared systems, as well as tips on how these devices can enhance communication in everyday situations.
