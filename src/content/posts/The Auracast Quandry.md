## Richard Pocker on Hearing Loss, Telecoils, and the Future of Access

<br><span class="teal-text">
Richard Pocker, author and bilateral cochlear implant user, shares his decades-long experience with hearing loss and the essential role that telecoil technology has played in enabling access to clear sound in public spaces.
<br><br>
While new Bluetooth-based tech like Auracast is being promoted as the future, it remains years from full adoption. Some manufacturers have already begun removing telecoils prematurely, leaving users without reliable access unless they use intermediary devices.</span>
<br><br>

### My hearing loss

<br>
I have needed hearing assistance for almost seven decades. My journey with hearing loss began at the age of five when I contracted Scarlet Fever. While the medications I received may have saved my life, they took my hearing. By the age of seven in 1958, I was wearing hearing aids. However, at thirty, I experienced a sudden and total collapse of all residual hearing. 
<br><br>
For the next 35 years, I was completely deaf, relying entirely on lip reading. In 2015, my life changed dramatically when I underwent simultaneous bilateral cochlear implant surgery. The results were transformative: I went from zero speech comprehension to 85%, and most recently, I was retested at an astounding 100%.
<br><br>
My first hearing aid was a transistor device, roughly the size of a cigarette pack, worn on a body harness. To use the telephone, I had to flip a switch on the hearing aid and hold the phone handset upside down. It was cumbersome, but it worked.
<br><br>

### Connecting to venues worldwide, via Telecoil

<br>
While hearing devices have advanced significantly over the years, one constant companion throughout this journey has been the telecoil.
<br><br>
A telecoil is a small wire coil embedded inside a hearing aid or cochlear implant. It captures magnetic signals from a hearing loop system and neck loops with FM and infrared, converting them into sound within the hearing device. This process significantly reduces background noise and delivers sound directly to the user, enhancing clarity and comprehension.
<br><br>
Over the decades, the adoption of assistive listening systems, expanded to venues worldwide—taxicabs, stores, airports, houses of worship, entertainment facilities, and even newsstands and bakeries in some countries. By simply switching to the telecoil setting, users could access broadcast signals directly, whether it was a minister’s sermon, a lecturer’s presentation, or an important announcement. The clarity and improvement in sound comprehension astonish first-time users. 
<br><br>
Telecoils eliminate background noise and counteract the deterioration of sound as it travels through the air.
There are tens of thousands of venues that have these systems worldwide. Since telecoil technology is universal and non-proprietary, hearing aid users from any country can benefit from these systems wherever they travel. Millions of hearing aids are already equipped to utilize this technology.
<br><br>

### New technology, Auracast, generation 1

<br>
When I upgraded my external processor to a Cochlear Nucleus 8 in December 2023, the promise of being “Auracast-ready” was compelling. Auracast was touted as the future. The industry proclaimed, “Telecoils are dead. Long live Auracast.” Yet, this shift posed challenges. More and more hearing aid manufacturers began omitting telecoils from their devices. 
<br><br>
The situation became alarming when Cochlear decided not to include telecoils in their Kanso 2, an off-the-ear external processor. This device now requires an intermediary accessory to capture the signal and transmit it via Bluetooth to the processor—a cumbersome and inconvenient solution. Similarly, Med El in the Sonnet 3 moved the telecoil to an accessory-also to operate. A simple click-on-the-switch operation now requires carrying another device. Ridiculous. Because audiologists and hearing aid specialists echoed the same refrain: “Auracast is the future. Telecoils are a thing of the past.” Efforts to advocate for hearing loop installations in venues became increasingly difficult as the mantra spread. But this narrative isn’t entirely accurate. 
<br><br>
The technology and infrastructure for Auracast are not yet ready. Manufacturing hurdles persist, and its full implementation remains years away. Recently, Auracast marketing has backtracked somewhat, acknowledging that hearing loops, FM, infrared, and Auracast will need to coexist for many years. For Auracast to succeed, venues must install compatible equipment, hearing devices must be upgraded, and even intermediary devices like smartphones will require changes. Unlike telecoils, which function with a simple flip of a switch, Auracast demands intermediary controls and specially equipped hearing devices. This has created unnecessary complexity, indiscrete headsets or accessories, all of which change the paradigm of what should be a seamless procedure.
<br><br>
Device manufacturers who believe that Auracast is fully operational today and are not preparing for the transition pose significant challenges. People need to hear today and not wait for years. It’s time to admit the mistakes, address the issues, and let consumers decide. Technology is wonderful, but history reminds us that advancements don’t always replace tried-and-true solutions. The first gas-powered automobile, introduced in 1880, still operates on the same basic principle today, despite decades of innovation. 
<br><br>

### My suggestions to address the issue

<br>
The only way that consumers can make sure we step into the future without abandoning the technology that still works, is to demand that device manufactures put BOTH telecoil and Auracast technologies in hearing aids and cochlear implants.  
<br><br>
The list of ADA Access Hearing Instruments is constantly being updated by the Center for Hearing Access. Do your research and choose devices that serve both technologies.
<br><br>
Request, in writing, your local venues, be it houses of worship, government offices, entertainment or health related, comply with ADA standards to serve your needs for hearing access.
