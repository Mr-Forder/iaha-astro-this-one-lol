title: My Telecoil Tale
description: "“Like many neophyte hearing aid buyers, I had not been told about this optional feature when fitted with the devices. The decision to include telecoils, which I had every right to make, had instead been made by my provider. I had been deprived of a feature that doubles the functionality of hearing aids, allowing users to hear in settings that had previously been problematic.”"

Stephen O. Frazier shares his thoughts and experiences of the humble telecoil – a technology he wasn’t even aware of until HLAA chapter coordinator Virginia Carr told him about them. He’d not been made aware that his hearing aid could be fitted with one – a decision made not by him, but hearing aid provider.
