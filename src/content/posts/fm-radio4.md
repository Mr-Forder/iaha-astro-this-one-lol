### FM Systems in Worship Spaces: Tradition Meets Inclusion

Many places of worship are turning to **FM assistive listening systems** to quietly support attendees with hearing loss—while preserving the character of the space.

A speaker’s voice is captured by a small mic and transmitted via FM signal to individual receivers, allowing users to hear clearly without affecting others.

FM systems are discreet, cost-effective, and easily implemented—even in **older buildings or temporary venues**. They don’t require visual cues or mobile apps, making them especially helpful for older users.

At IAHA, we champion solutions that keep **faith and inclusion side by side**, with minimal barriers to participation.
