Libraries have long been a sanctuary of quiet access—and now, they’re integrating **audio over Wi-Fi** to make events more inclusive without disrupting the peace.

From author readings to discussion groups, these systems allow individuals with hearing loss to stream real-time audio to their phones and earbuds—no need for large speaker setups or visible devices.

The experience is discreet and non-intrusive, aligning perfectly with the ethos of library spaces. However, onboarding for less tech-savvy users remains an area for thoughtful planning.

IAHA encourages institutions to explore this **quietly powerful technology**, ensuring their services remain inclusive, respectful, and community-driven.
