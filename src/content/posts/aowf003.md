In university lecture halls, clear audio can make all the difference. Audio over Wi-Fi gives students with hearing loss **real-time, reliable access** to spoken content via their own devices.

From large lecture halls to busy event spaces, these systems support academic inclusion without requiring complex installations. A student simply opens the campus app, joins the stream, and listens directly via their smartphone or tablet.

This form of assistive listening works well in tech-literate environments, although **latency and Wi-Fi quality** must be managed carefully.

At IAHA, we see this as a critical tool for **equal access to education**, especially in spaces with changing layouts or temporary usesâ€”like pop-up classrooms or hybrid events.
