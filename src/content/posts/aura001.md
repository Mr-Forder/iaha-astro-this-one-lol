Auracast™ broadcast audio represents a **major leap forward** in how we think about inclusive listening. By sending high-quality audio to an unlimited number of compatible devices—like hearing aids, earbuds, and smartphones—Auracast has the potential to **transform accessibility in public venues**.

Unlike older assistive listening systems that require specialised receivers, Auracast allows users to listen through their own Bluetooth LE Audio-compatible devices. This helps **remove stigma and improve convenience**, enabling broader adoption across age groups and accessibility needs.

Venues such as **airports, cinemas, places of worship, and transit hubs** can now provide seamless audio access without extensive infrastructure overhauls. For the user, tuning in is as simple as selecting the broadcast—much like connecting to Wi-Fi.

At IAHA, we see Auracast as a **key player** in the future of hearing accessibility. It blends **convenience, discretion, and inclusivity**, giving more people access to the sounds that matter most in everyday life.
