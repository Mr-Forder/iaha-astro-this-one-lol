Whether you're watching a movie with family or waiting at a busy train station, Auracast makes it possible to **share high-quality audio wirelessly and effortlessly**.

Using the latest Bluetooth LE Audio technology, Auracast allows multiple users to connect to the same audio stream in real time. This creates **shared listening experiences** that feel natural and inclusive—whether you're using hearing aids, headphones, or mobile devices.

Auracast also holds promise in **classrooms, fitness centres, and conference venues**, where large groups can benefit from clear audio without complex setups or proprietary hardware. And because it's built on Bluetooth LE, battery life and power efficiency are significantly improved.

At IAHA, we’re excited about how Auracast can **bridge personal and public audio needs**, delivering **unified sound experiences** without compromise.
