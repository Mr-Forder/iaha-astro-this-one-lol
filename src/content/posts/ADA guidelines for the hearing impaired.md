The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects people with hearing loss across employment, public spaces, and digital services. From captioned telephones to assistive listening systems like hearing loops in courtrooms and airports, these protections aren't optional, they're required by law.

This clear explainer from Healthy Hearing walks through what the ADA covers, what it doesnâ€™t, and how recent updates impact accessibility online.Well worth a read.
