In the world of conferences and events, accessibility is often an afterthought. But **audio over Wi-Fi** is changing that.

With a dedicated Wi-Fi stream and a simple app, event organisers can allow attendees to tune into panel discussions, keynotes, or breakout sessions—on their own devices, in real time.

This empowers those with hearing loss to control volume and clarity, even in large or acoustically challenging venues. It also avoids the logistical headache of distributing and sanitising headsets.

At IAHA, we support scalable solutions that make **temporary venues more inclusive**, ensuring access doesn’t depend on the space, but on the intent.
