title: How to Improve Audiology Services- The Patient Perspective
description: '"It is important for audiologists to reconsider the potential barriers causing such low numbers of hearing aid uptake and use. Numerous factors have been ascribed as reasons for this underutilization, from access and affordability, continued difficulty understanding speech in a group or noisy situation even when wearing hearing aids, to the well-known factor of stigma associated with hearing aids. Merely owning hearing aids does not necessarily result in their use."'

Only 17% of people who need hearing aids use them, despite growing evidence that treating hearing loss improves quality of life, mental health, and even cognitive function.

This recent systematic review looked at 25 qualitative studies to understand what hearing aid users actually want from audiology services. It found that people value much more than just the device, with a focus on the human side of hearing care, with a need for collaborative, patient-centred approach.
