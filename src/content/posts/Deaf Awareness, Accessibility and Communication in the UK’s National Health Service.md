title: Deaf Awareness, Accessibility and Communication in the UK’s National Health Service
description: '"The real power of this study lies in the stories people shared. Patients weren’t just rating their experiences – they were telling us how these barriers affect every part of their healthcare journey, and in many cases, why they avoid healthcare altogether. ”'

A UK-wide study from Plos One looks into the experiences of people with hearing loss when using NHS services, revealing that many struggle to understand important medical information due to poor communication and a lack of overall deaf awareness.

Most respondents missed key details during appointments, felt frustrated by inconsistent support, and often had to rely on others to communicate.
