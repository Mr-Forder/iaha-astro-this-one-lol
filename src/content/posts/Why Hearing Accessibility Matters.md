title: Why Hearing Accessibility Matters
description: '"The moral of this story is that "only those who wear shoes know where it pinches". There are over 10 million hearing aid users in the UK. We need to take on board that wherever there is a gathering of people who need to hear from a Public Address or sound reinforcement system there will be people who are supplementing their damaged hearing with a hearing aid."'
