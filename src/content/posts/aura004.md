Auracast isn't just a broadcast audio technology—it's a **foundation for the future** of accessible and interoperable listening.

By leveraging the Bluetooth LE Audio standard, Auracast enables devices to transmit and receive audio across an **open, low-energy, and scalable ecosystem**. This allows hearing aids, earbuds, and phones to seamlessly connect to public broadcasts, **blurring the lines between consumer tech and assistive devices**.

As more manufacturers and venues adopt Auracast, we’ll see an ecosystem where accessibility is **built-in rather than bolted on**—from smart TVs and laptops to airport gates and public events.

At IAHA, we view Auracast as more than a tool. It’s a **platform for integration**, innovation, and inclusion—one that will shape how people hear, connect, and participate in the world around them.
