### Supporting Guided Tours with FM Listening Technology

For tour operators and heritage venues, **FM assistive listening systems** offer a simple way to maintain connection with visitors who have hearing loss.

In busy or acoustically challenging environments, a guide's voice can get lost. FM systems solve this by transmitting audio via radio frequency directly to personal receivers, ensuring each participant hears clearly—no matter the noise level or distance.

They’re portable, durable, and don't rely on mobile apps or Wi-Fi—making them perfect for **historic sites, museums, or outdoor tours**.

At IAHA, we value technologies that respect **both accessibility and cultural experience**. FM systems deliver both with ease.
